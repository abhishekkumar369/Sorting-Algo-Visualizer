# Sorting Algorithm Visualizer
This is a web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to visualize classic sorting algorithms such as bubble sort, insertion sort, selection sort, merge sort, and quick sort. The main objective of this project is to provide an interactive and educational tool for understanding how these fundamental sorting algorithms work.

# Purpose
The primary motivation behind creating this sorting visualizer web application is to improve my skills in web development technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Additionally, it serves as a valuable educational resource for beginners in programming. Sorting algorithms are a crucial part of computer science education, and visualizing them can significantly aid in comprehending their mechanics and efficiency. This application allows users to see the step-by-step process of how different sorting algorithms organize data, making it easier to grasp their underlying principles.

# Features
This application supports the following sorting algorithms:
  1. **Bubble Sort**.
  2. **Insertion Sort**.
  3. **Selection Sort**.
  4. **Merge Sort**.
  5. **Quick Sort**.



(1) Bubble Sort: Visualizes the process of repeatedly stepping through the list, comparing adjacent elements and swapping them if they are in the wrong order.
(2) Insertion Sort: Demonstrates how the algorithm builds the sorted array one item at a time by repeatedly taking the next element from the unsorted part and inserting it into the correct position.

(3) Selection Sort: Shows the process of selecting the smallest (or largest) element from the unsorted part and swapping it with the first unsorted element.

(4) Merge Sort: Illustrates the divide-and-conquer approach, where the array is recursively divided into smaller arrays until each contains a single element, and then merged back together in sorted order.

(5) Quick Sort: Displays the algorithm's partitioning process, where the array is divided into sub-arrays around a pivot element, which are then sorted independently.



By using this visualizer, users can interactively see how data is sorted and gain insights into the time complexity and efficiency of each algorithm. The application is designed to be intuitive and user-friendly, making it an excellent tool for both learning and teaching.
